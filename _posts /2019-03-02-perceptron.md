Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.



Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
